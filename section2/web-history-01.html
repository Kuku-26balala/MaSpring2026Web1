        <h2>History of the Web</h2>

        <h3>1945, Memex, Vannevar Bush</h3>
        The Memex was a concept described by Vannevar Bush in 1945. It was a machine that could store and organize
        information. Bush imagined that people could link documents together. This idea later influenced the development
        of hypertext and the Web.

        <p>
            Project Xanadu was created by Ted Nelson in the 1960s. He introduced the idea of “hypertext,” which allows
            documents to link to each other. Xanadu imagined a global network of connected information. This idea
            strongly influenced the World Wide Web.

        <h3>1960s The birth of the Internet ARPANET</h3>
        <p>
            ARPANET was the first network that connected computers over long distances. It was funded by the U.S.
            government. Researchers used it to share information between universities. ARPANET later became the
            foundation of today's Internet.

        <h3>first email Ray Tomlinson 1971</h3>
        <p>
            Ray Tomlinson sent the first email in 1971. He was the first person to use the “@” symbol in an email
            address. Email made communication between computers much easier. It quickly became one of the most popular
            uses of the Internet.

        <h3>Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn 1983</h3>
        <p>
            TCP/IP is the main communication system used by the Internet. It allows different networks to connect and
            share data. In 1983, ARPANET adopted TCP/IP. This moment is considered the official start of the modern
            Internet.

        <h3>Invention of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at the European Council for Nuclear
            Research (CERN) 1989</h3>
        <p>
            In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at CERN. He wanted to make it easier for scientists to
            share information. The Web uses links to connect documents. This invention changed the way people use the
            Internet.

        <h3>Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER Tim Berners-Lee 1990</h3>
        <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee also created URL, HTTP, and HTML in 1990. URL is the address of a webpage. HTTP transfers
            information between servers and browsers. HTML is the language used to build webpages. These tools made
            websites possible.

        <p>
            The first photo on the Web was uploaded in 1992. It showed a music group called Les Horribles Cernettes. It
            was uploaded by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. This showed that the Web could share images, not just text.
